    description: 'As a user, we all are interested in easy and user-friendly websites to work on.\
    We tend to use those applications which give us native app feel. AngularJS has made this possible.\
    This framework gives Developers ready templates and well-built infrastructure.This has made\
    the developers and designers task very easy and hurdle free. The data flow can be monitored\
    and captured between the ‘view’ and ‘control’ and vice versa. As we all know a big application\
    is built up from different modules and logics which are tied together. These modules are dependent\
    on each other though they are initialized separately each time. Dependency Injection makes it\
    possible for them to be designed and built separately at any level of development without\
    disturbing another module.',

    description: 'People new to JavaScript get a little confused about why we make such a big deal\
     about modules. I want to make one thing clear: Modules are NOT for lazy-loading JavaScript\
     components when needed. Require.js does have this functionality, but that is not the reason it is\
     important. Modules are important due to the language not having support for it, and JavaScript\
     desperately needing it.A module can be different things.It could be Angular, lodash(you’re not\
     still using underscore, are you?), shared code in your organization, some gist you found online,\
     or separating features out inside your codebase.',

    description: 'AngularJS is an extremely stable framework for building web applications, and has been\
     used by millions of developers across the web. Angular is its successor and uses the same philosophies\
     such as declarative templates and dependency injection.\ Angular has been growing more than 5x faster\
     than AngularJS did since its original release.In October of 2017, the user base of Angular passed\
     1 million developers(based on 30 day users to our documentation), and became larger than the user\
     base of AngularJS.We have many exciting Angular releases planned in 2018 and beyond.',
